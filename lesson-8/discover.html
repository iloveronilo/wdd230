      <h3>Corregidor Island</h3>
      <p>
        Corregidor is a small rocky island located near Bataan and Manila Bay.
        It was once the headquarters of allied Filipino and American forces who
        fought against the Japanese during World War II, and a witness to the
        braveries of these soldiers. While Japanese had occupied lots of places
        in the Philippines, they avoided Corregidor because of the fear for the
        huge canyons surrounding the place.

        Philippine West Sea crashing into the rock formations. The cove is a
        rugged terrain which gives you a marvelous view of the sea and its
        surroundings. Panoypoy Cove is actually one of the coves that forms
        Mariveles, known as the Five Fingers, due to the finger-like shapes of
        the island. The trip to the cove requires a short trek, and the only way
        to go there is to pass by the Hawla Beach, now known as the Claubel
        Beach Resort, which is quite hidden in the area of Panoypoy Cove. The
        trek is quite tiring but when you reach the top, you’ll realize it was
        worth the effort as soon as you see the meeting of land and sea.
